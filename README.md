Applied Math 585, Winter Quarter 2020

The [Class webpage](http://staff.washington.edu/rjl/classes/am585w2020/)
is built using the files in the `sphinx` directory, using [sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/).

You can view rendered versions of the Jupyter notebooks from this repository at 
[this link](https://rjleveque.github.io/amath585w2020/notebooks/html/Index.html),
and the html files are also in the directory `notebooks/html`.  Note that
interactive widgets do not work when viewing notebooks this way, but many
animations do show up properly.

To run the notebooks on the cloud service [binder](http://mybinder.org),
you can [launch binder](http://mybinder.org/repo/rjleveque/amath585w2020),
or clone this repository to run them locally.

For more information, see the 
[Code and notebooks](http://staff.washington.edu/rjl/classes/am585w2020/codes.html)
