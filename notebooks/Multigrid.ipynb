    "## Key idea\n",
    "\n",
    "The high-frequency part of error is smoothed more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that if our iterative method is $U^{[k+1]} = GU^{[k]} + c$ as in (4.10), then the error satisfies $e^{[k+1]} = Ge^{[k]}$ and so expanding the error in eigenvectors of $G$ we can relate the decay of different eigencomponents to the eigenvalues of $G$, and recall that for this system and Jacobi, the $p$th eigenvector has $j$th component $\\sin(p\\pi jh) = \\sin(p\\pi x_j)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the error is smooth, we can:\n",
    "- Approximate the error on a coarser grid (as described below),\n",
    "- Interpolate the approximate error back to the original grid,\n",
    "- Correct the solution on this grid using the approximate error to get a **much** better approximate solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approximating the error\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are trying to solve $Au^* = f$ for exact solution $u^*$, and the residual for some approximate solution $u$ is defined as $r = f - Au$, then we can compute the residual $r^{[k]} = f - AU^{[k]}$ for the iterate in any step. By subtracting $Au^* = f$ from $AU^{[k]} = f - r^{[k]}$ we also see that $Ae^{[k]} = -r^{[k]}$, which is (4.91) in the book with slightly different notation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So from the residual $r^{[k]}$ we can approximate the error $e^{[k]}$ by solving a linear system that involves $A$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using this, we can expand the algorithm above to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute the residual (which is also smooth),\n",
    "- Sample the residual on a coarser grid,\n",
    "- Approximately solve $Ae = r$ on the coarser grid for the error,\n",
    "- Interpolate the approximate error back to the original grid,\n",
    "- Correct the solution on this grid using the approximate error to get a **much** better approximate solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that solving $Ae = r$ on the coarser grid has two big advantages: \n",
    "1. It is a smaller system, so less work per iteration, and \n",
    "2. Components of the error that were decaying slowly on the original grid, because there were many points per wavelength, decay much faster on a coarser grid, where there are fewer points per wavelength.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Repeat recursively\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key point is that to approximate the error on a coarser grid, we don't need to solve the system exactly on that grid -- after iterating a few times we will have smoothed out the error in this system and can transfer to an even coarser grid, with fewer grid points and fewer points per wavelength in some components of the remaining error.

    "Note that in only 4 iterations, for example, all components of the error for $p > m/2$ have been reduced by a factor of at least $(1/3)^4 \\approx 0.012$.  At this point one might sample the residual at every other point and switch to solving $Ae = r$ for this system.  Again only a few iterations are needed to damp all the the higher frequencies, which now means all $p > m/4$ from the original system size $m$.  Since convergence now starts to slow down on this grid, repeat by subsampling only every other point to get a new system of size $m/4$.  Continue this process until the system is small enough to solve the system by Gauss Elimination.  And then work your way back up correcting each solution as you go.\n",
