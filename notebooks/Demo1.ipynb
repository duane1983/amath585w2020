    "\n",
    "Instead you can specify `%matplotlib notebook` so they show up in a manner that you can interact with them, e.g. zooming in.   If you do this then when you give plot commands in more than one cell you should close earlier figures before plotting new ones (or your plot will be sent to the previous figure), or start each such cell with a `figure` command.  If you have too many figures open at once in this mode, you may get an error message telling you to close some.  Closing a figure will leave the figure in the notebook, but it's no longer interactive."
