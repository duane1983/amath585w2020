Not only is this simpler to manage than reshaping grid functions back and forth into vectors, it is also easier to write the matrix-vector multiply function by keeping `U` as a grid function and applying the stencil based on neighboring points on the grid rather than having to determine where each neighbor winds up in the reshaped vector.  The number of equations in the linear system is the same as the number of unknowns and we can associate each equation with a grid point by applying the finite-difference method at this point.\n",

    "## Inner-product function\n",
    "\n",
    "The C-G algorithm requires taking inner products of two vectors in various places.  In the 1D case the inner product of vectors `v` and `w` can be computed using `dot(v,w)`, which we used in [ConjugateGradient.ipynb](ConjugateGradient.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "This won't work in 2D since we want to leave `V` and `W` as 2D grid functions rather than reshaping them into 1D vectors, and so `dot(V,W)` would mean the matrix product $VW$ which would not even be defined if `mx` is not equal to `my` and in any case would be the wrong thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead the inner product can be defined by `sum(V*W)`.  Recall that in Python `V*W` means the element-wise product of the numpy arrays `V` and `W`, so it is an array of the same shape as `V` and `W` (in Matlab this would be `V.*W`).  Then `sum()` computes the sum of all elements in an array and returns a scalar.  This is the proper inner product in 2D and this would also work in 1D instead of `dot` (and works in 3D if `V` and `W` are 3D numpy arrays).  Note also that [numpy.inner](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.inner.html) does not return the right thing the way we are using these arrays."
