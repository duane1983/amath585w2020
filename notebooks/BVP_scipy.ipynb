    "# Using the BVP solver in scipy \n",
    "\n",
    "[AMath 585, Winter Quarter 2020](http://staff.washington.edu/rjl/classes/am585w2020/) at the University of Washington. Developed by R.J. LeVeque and distributed under the [BSD license](https://github.com/rjleveque/amath585w2020/blob/master/LICENSE).  You are free to modify and use as you please, with attribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "These notebooks are all [available on Github](https://github.com/rjleveque/amath585w2020/).\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is valuable to understand how to go about setting up a BVP solver yourself in order to understand the various issues that arise, and the ways that things might go wrong.  But for many real problems the best way to actually solve it is to use high-quality software that has been designed by experts and that has features such as adaptive choice of grids built in.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook briefly illustrates how to use the [`scipy.integrate.solve_bvp`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.18.1/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_bvp.html), which uses a [collocation method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collocation_method) and adaptively chooses the grid nodes based on a specified initial grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The collocation method used does not return approximate solution values at a set of points (as the finite difference method does).  Instead it returns a representation of a cubic sline, a piecewise cubic function that is a cubic polynomial on each interval between *nodes*.  A spline has the property that it is continuous and also has continuous first and second derivatives at each node, and hence is quite smooth.  To plot the solution you have to evaluate this function at a set of points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specifying the BVP\n",
    "\n",
    "The `solve_bvp` function is written in a way that it can be used to solve BVPs with arbitrary order derivatives, e.g. both $u''(x) = f(x)$ and $u''''(x) = f(x)$ (and much more complicated nonlinear problems).  It does so by actually solving a *system* of ODEs of the form\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y'(x) = f(x,y)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $y(x)$ is a vector with $n$ components.  As described at the start of Chapter 5 in the textbook, a higher-order scalar equation can generally be rewritten as a first-order system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for $u''(x) = f(x)$, let $y_0(x) = u(x)$ and $y_1(x) = u'(x)$.  Then the system of equations is\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "y_0'(x) &= y_1(x),\\\\\n",
    "y_1'(x) &= f(x).\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "If the original problem had Dirichlet boundary conditions $u(a)=\\alpha$, $u(b)=\\beta$ then the system has boundary conditions\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "y_0(a) &= \\alpha,\\\\\n",
    "y_0(b) &= \\beta.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "A Neumann boundary condition $u'(a) = \\alpha_1$ could be expressed as $y_1(a) = \\alpha_1$ in place of the first equation above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `solve_bvp` function has one argument that is the function `f` and another argument that is a function `bc` that takes two n-vectors `ya, yb` as input and returns $n$ values that should be zero, e.g. `ya[0]-alpha` and `yb[0]-beta` for the Dirichlet case in this second-order ($n=2$) equation.  You also have to specify the initial set of nodes (the first and last of which are the end points of the interval), and an initial guess for the solution values at these nodes.  The software will adjust the nodes to try to achieve some estimated error.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other optional arguments that can be specified, see the [documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.18.1/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_bvp.html).\n"
