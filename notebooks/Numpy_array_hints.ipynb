    "\n",
    "However, if `A` is a numpy array and you set `B = A` and then modify some element of `B`, the corresponding element of `A` also changes!\n",
    "\n",
    "That's because Python is an object-oriented language and a numpy array is what's called a **mutable object**, meaning you can change certain attributes of it without changing the basic object or where it's stored in memory.  If `A` is a mutable object and you do `B = A` then you are simply creating a new pointer to *the same object.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Integers and floats are **immutable objects** and doing `b = a` above implicitly forces Python to create a new object and initialize it with the value `a` has.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can do the same thing for a numpy array by setting `B = A.copy()`, and then `B` is a new object initialized with the attributes of `A` but it can be changed independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the main difference between a *tuple* such as `(1,2,\"A\")` and a *list* `[1,2,\"A\"]` is that a list is mutable (e.g. you can change an element or use the `append` method) while a tuple is always immutable.  Sometimes it's important which you use, sometimes not.  Google \"Python mutable objects\" for many tutorials.\n",
