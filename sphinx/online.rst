Information for online students
===============================

Exams and proctors
-------------------

Local online students may take exams on the UW Seattle campus if
there is space available in the classroom. There should be plenty of space,
but please check with the TA to
confirm your seat.  

Otherwise, online exams must be 
`proctored <https://forms.gle/x6qGF1t8XiHJP6pA9>`_.
Please read this page well in advance of exams since proctors must be
pre-approved.

Midterms and finals must be completed
on the same day and (if possible) at the same time as the in-class
course. If the indicated schedule cannot be arranged, contact the
professor or TA to discuss an alternative time.  For reference,
Seattle is in the Pacific time zone and observes daylight saving
time.

Office hours
------------

Both the intructor and TA have scheduled online office hours using
`GoToMeeting <https://www.gotomeeting.com/>`_, see :ref:`info` for times.

You do not need to purchase anything to use GoToMeeting, links for the
office hours will be posted.
