Homework 6
=============================================================


Due by 11:00pm on March 12, 2020

**Note:** Submit a pdf file via the Canvas assignment page
`Homework 6 <https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1352870/assignments/5284853>`_.

- `hw6.pdf <_static/hw6.pdf>`_

- See :ref:`hwformat` for a discussion of formatting.  

- If you want to use latex for your solutions, you can start with the file
  `hw6.tex`, which includes commented-out sections where you can insert
  solutions.  This can be found in the class repository (after cloning and
  perhaps doing a `git pull`, see :ref:`class_repos`) 
  as `$AM585/homeworks/hw6/hw6.tex`.  Note that this uses some macros from the 
  file `$AM585/homeworks/latex/macros.tex`.

- If you use a notebook for part or all of this, please submit both the `.ipynb`
  file and the `.html` or `.pdf` file that is generated via the `Files --> Download
  as...` menu, or with the `jupyter nbconvert` command.   
  If you use a Python or Matlab script, please submit the `.py` or `.m` file.
