Take-home final exam
=============================================================


Due by 11:00pm on March 17, 2020

**Note:** Submit a pdf file via the Canvas assignment page
`Final exam<https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1352870/assignments/>`_.

- `amath585_final.pdf <_static/amath585_final.pdf>`_

- See :ref:`hwformat` for a discussion of formatting.  

- If you want to use latex for your solutions, you can start with the file
  `amath585_final.tex`, which includes commented-out sections where you can insert
  solutions.  This can be found in the class repository (after cloning and
  perhaps doing a `git pull`, see :ref:`class_repos`) 
  as `$AM585/homeworks/final/amath585_final.tex`.  
  Note that this uses some macros from the 
  file `$AM585/homeworks/latex/macros.tex`.

- If you use a notebook for part or all of this, please submit both the `.ipynb`
  file and the `.html` or `.pdf` file that is generated via the `Files --> Download
  as...` menu, or with the `jupyter nbconvert` command.   
  If you use a Python or Matlab script, please submit the `.py` or `.m` file.
