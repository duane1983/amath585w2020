=============================================================
Homework
=============================================================


There will be 6 homework assignments during the quarter, requiring a
combination of analytical and programming work.
See :ref:`hwformat` below for information on the desired format.

*Late homework:*  Homeworks will generally be due Thursday evenings at
11:00pm to a Canvas dropbox.  You may turn in an assignment up to 24
hours late with a reduction of 10% for tardiness.  After that homework
will not be accepted unless you have made arrangements in advance due to 
special circumstances.

There will also be in-class midterm and final exams, see :ref:`info` for
details.

.. _hwformat:

Homework format
---------------

Homework should be submitted online via the 
`Canvas page <https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1352870>`_.

Written solutions should be submitted as pdf files (not Word, please).
Ideally these should be typeset using latex.  (See :ref:`biblio_latex`
for some references).  Or you can hand write and scan, but
typeset work is much easier to grade and is good practice, so I encourage
you to do some problems in latex..

You can also write analytical solutions in a Jupyter notebook if
you wish to, which makes it particularly easy to mix analysis with
code illustrations.  

If you use a notebook, please submit both the `.ipynb` file and the
`.html` or `.pdf` file that is generated via the `Files --> Download as...` 
menu, or with the `jupyter nbconvert` command.  

If you use a Python script, please submit the `.py` file, or a `.m` file if
you use Matlab.

For computer code, please include suitable documentation to describe
what you've done and also explain it in your written solutions when
appropriate.  Include appropriate figures in your writeup.

.. _hw:matlab:

Matlab vs. Python
------------------

I strongly encourage you to learn Python and Jupyter notebooks if you don't
already use these, since they are becoming standard in many fields of
scientific computing.  Moreover they are open source and freely available,
so you can continue to use them beyond the lifetime of your student version
of Matlab.

The demonstrations and sample code given in class will be done in Python,
typically in a Jupyter notebook and archived in the `notebooks` directory of
this repository.  Some of the homework assignments will be based directly on
notebooks, so you will find it easiest to use Python and Jupyter notebooks
to do the assignments.  Some tutorials will be given in class and many
resources are available online, see :ref:`python`.

You may use Matlab if you insist, but you may have to do some extra work to
convert code provided from Python to Matlab.  Note that there are some
Matlab scripts available on 
`the textbook webpage <http://faculty.washington.edu/rjl/fdmbook/>`_
that may be useful, but I am working on developing Jupyter notebooks to
cover similar material and more.
