Code and notebooks
==================

Matlab scripts to accompany the book 
------------------------------------

See `the book webpage <http://faculty.washington.edu/rjl/fdmbook/>`_

Jupyter notebooks
-----------------

Rendered html versions of the notebooks can be viewed at `this
link <https://rjleveque.github.io/amath585w2020/notebooks/html/Index.html>`_.

You can also view them directly on the GitHub webpages at
https://github.com/rjleveque/amath585w2020/tree/master/notebooks.
This shows the notebook as it was last committed to the repository,
which might or might not include the output cells. (Usually I delete
the output before committing, particularly if there are lots of
figures.)  At any rate you won't be able to change anything or
execute the notebook.

If you want to modify something in a notebook and re-execute, you
will need to download the notebook (or find it in the :ref:`class_repos`,
in the `notebooks` directory).

You will need a recent version of Jupyter in order to run a `Jupyter
notebook <http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.
See :ref:`python`.

If you want to easily run notebooks without installing any software, you
might try `CoCalc <http:www.cocalc.com>`_.
You can create a free account, but in order to transfer 
files back to or from CoCalc (e.g. for a homework assignment) you would need
to `subscribe <https://cocalc.com/policies/pricing.html>`_.

You can also run notebooks from this class repository in the cloud
using `binder <http://mybinder.org>`_.  To do so, simply |binder_link|.
This will open a new tab and then might take a minute to start up
a kernel, after which you should be able to navigate to the `notebooks`
directory and start a notebook.

Recall that you can select `Run All` from the `Cell` menu to execute the entire
notebook and see all the output.
